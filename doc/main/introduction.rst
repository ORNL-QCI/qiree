Introduction

Welcome to the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE)
[#qiree_vers]_, a state-of-the-art tool designed to streamline the process of
running quantum circuits and algorithms. Whether you're a researcher, student,
or enthusiast, QIR-EE (pronounced 'cure-ee') is designed to make your journey
into quantum computing as seamless as possible. This implementation is
associated to the paper "A Cross-Platform Execution Engine for the Quantum
Intermediate Representation" [#qiree_paper]_ and is maintained by the QIR-EE
Developers.

At version 0.1, this work represents a proof-of-concept for the feasibility of
a modular workflow at the lower end of the quantum software stack. We welcome
feedback and ideas for collaborations.
